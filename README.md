Hi, I'm a coder and gamer. I've been working with code for several years, and I primarily focus on Kotlin, especially for Android development. I appreciate Kotlin for its efficiency and modern features, which make development smoother.

Gaming is another passion of mine. I enjoy a variety of genres and often find that my experiences in gaming influence my approach to coding and app design.

I also contribute Kotlin code to open-source projects when I can. It’s a good way to learn and collaborate with others in the community. If you’re interested in coding or gaming, feel free to reach out.
